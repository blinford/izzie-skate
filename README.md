simple godot game with custom physics script to simulate skateboard movement

play here: https://blinford.github.io/izzie-skate/

TODO:
- improve models
  - replace cube with izzie
  - use textures for skatepark
- fix issue with sudden stops on slopes
- implement friction (previously working but the slope physics messed with code)
- add animations/vfx
